# Ganbreeder

[Ganbreeder](https://ganbreeder.app) is a collaborative art tool for discovering images. Images are 'bred' by having children, mixing with other images and being shared via their URL. This is an experiment in using breeding + sharing as methods of exploring high complexity spaces. GAN's are simply the engine enabling this. Ganbreeder is very similar to, and named after, Picbreeder. It is also inspired by an earlier project of mine [Facebook Graffiti](http://www.joelsimon.net/facebook-graffiti.html) which demonstrated the creative capacity of crowds.Ganbreeder uses [these](https://tfhub.dev/deepmind/biggan-128/2) models.

This code was made in a weekend and hasn't been cleaned up or documented yet. There are also improvements to make to scalability.

Pull request are more than welcome :)
